# Privacy Policy for ChatGPT Navigator

**Last Updated: December 3, 2025**

ChatGPT Navigator ("we", "our", or "us") is dedicated to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension handles your data.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data, chat history, or browsing activity to external servers.**

The extension operates entirely locally on your device. It interacts with the web page (chatgpt.com) solely to:
*   Read the headings and prompts within the active tab to generate a navigation sidebar.
*   Inject the sidebar user interface into the page.

## 2. Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions to function:

*   **Storage**: This is used strictly to save your local preferences, such as whether the sidebar is expanded or collapsed. This data never leaves your browser.
*   **Host Permissions (https://chatgpt.com/*)**: This is required to access the content of the ChatGPT page you are viewing so the extension can identify headings and prompts to build the navigation index.

## 3. Third-Party Services

This extension does not use any third-party analytics, tracking tools, or advertising services.

## 4. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by updating the date at the top of this policy.

## 5. Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us via the support section on the Chrome Web Store listing.
